        <h1>SecureJS</h1>

<p>An extension of the JavaScript Object such that getting and setting data in the object is only possible when 
providing a predetermined access key.</p>

<p>This key is first used to instantiate the SecureObject and subsequently used when storing and retrieving data 
from the SecureObject.</p>

<h3>SecureJS satisfies the following requirements</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>An object constructor with one parameter that defines the access key should be used to instantiate the SecureObject.</p></li>
<li><p>The object should allow storing and retrieving data only if the supplied access key matches the original access key used to instantiate the SecureObject, otherwise an exception should be thrown.</p></li>
<li><p>It should <em>NOT</em> be possible to inspect the object and sniff out the contents, i.e. inspecting in Firebug or iterating over properties with a for/in loop would yield no valuable information whatsoever.</p></li>
<li><p>It should <em>NOT</em> be possible to peel into the object to obtain the access key used to instantiate the SecureObject</p></li>
<li><p>We are not looking for functionality that encrypts/decrypts the stored data. -- We only want to store data in such a way that you can only gain read / write privileges by supplying the access key.</p></li>
</ol><h3>How does SecureJS work?</h3>

<p>SecureJS creates private instance members of the class it defines by forming a closure when objects are instanitiated. 
This is accomplished by wrapping the function in an anonymous self executing function that returns the constructor making 
it possible to form a closure that includes both the class constructor and local variables. </p>

<p>Thus you can encapsulate and hide 
the attributes of the object and use a privileged method to interact with a private method that checks the validity of the 
supplied access key, making it possible to avoid ever returning the actual access key. </p>

<p>Additionally you can use the same set of functions to perform an access key check whenever you want to get or set any of the 
objects other attributes.</p>

<p>All the while the exact details surrounding your implementation of SecureJS and a given instance of the secure object class 
remain hidden from the end user.</p>

<h3>Notes on Encapsulation and Information Hiding in JavaScript</h3>

<p>I have included the notes I took on the topic of encapsulation and information hiding in JavaScript that I took while
writing SecureJS.js.</p>
